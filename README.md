# Best Practices for Writing Technical Documentation

Documents are valuable instruments for our day-to-day work. When you are writing technical documentation for your team, it’s important to acknowledge the good practices listed below that will enlighten your team’s experience and understanding.

## Consider your audience

Whenever you are writing a document keep in mind what the level of the target audience is. Make sure you produce content that matches with the different areas of expertise and background knowledge the members of your team have. That avoids exposing your readers to unnecessary and unuseful information.

## Be organized

It’s not hard to find a large number of documents stored in different platforms. Although this might be a common practice, aim at having documents stored in a single platform so your team has a consistent and organized experience.

A great deal of working well with documentation comes from writing, but not limited to it. Encourage your team to maintain only a single platform so you can all save time and improve productivity when handling documents. 

## Follow a style guide

Style guides are vital when we create documentation. It contains instructions on how to standardize content and make sure all documents reflect the same style and convey consistency within our documents. The Chicago Manual of Style and the Google developer documentation style guide are great resources to look into when creating content.  

## Use acronyms properly

If you need to use an acronym, after mentioning it for the first time, write its full name in brackets to explain the abbreviation. After that, use only the acronym when mentioning it again. Example: DIY (Do It Yourself) videos are a great way to improve your craft skills and creativity. See the most watched DIY videos of 2022 to get inspired.

## Use lists whenever possible

Procedural instructions or a list of descriptive items are very important to complete a task. They should be displayed in a numbered or bullet list instead of in a long and tiring paragraph. Lists are a great way to convey essential information in a clear and fast way.
